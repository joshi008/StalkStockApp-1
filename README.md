<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)



Motivation:
Stock market is still an enigma for a lot of people. And even though you can study about it and think you understand it enough to take the first step, it is always difficult to buy that first stock. Because every investment comes with an attached expectation of profit, and it is not an unfair expectation. Hence we wanted to simulate the experience of stock market without the need to spend real money.

Our Solution:
We made an android application that 
* uses real time stock APIs to simulate the stock market.
* provides user with accounts and a certain amount of money to start with.
* provides option of browsing and monitoring different stocks.
* allows buying and selling of stocks as per will, with the aim of maximizing profit.
* gives a dashboard to make it all easily accessible. 


### Built With

* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/)
